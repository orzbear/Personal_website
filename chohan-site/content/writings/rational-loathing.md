## Abstract
Supporters of Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and Kuomintang (KMT) increasingly detest their opposing party. This study analyzes 2020 TIGCR survey data and finds that affective polarization correlates with policy disagreements—particularly on cross-Strait and transitional-justice issues—whereas nuclear-power policy shows the opposite pattern. The results suggest that emotional hostility among partisans in Taiwan has rational policy foundations rather than being purely “irrational and uncivil.”

## 1  Introduction
Taiwan’s partisan conflict has intensified in the 21st century, yet evidence for ideological polarization remains mixed. …

## 2  Method and Data
Using the Taiwan Institute for Governance and Communication Research (TIGCR) 2020 dataset, I estimate two models:  
(1) OLS regression of negative party impression, and  
(2) Ordered-logit model of social-distance ratings. …

## 3  Findings
- Cross-Strait and transitional-justice preferences significantly predict negative affect.  
- Nuclear-power preferences have no positive association with dislike of out-partisans.  
- Partisanship strength remains the most consistent control predictor. …

## 4  Discussion
These findings indicate that affective polarization in Taiwan reflects concrete policy divides. “Rational loathing” better characterizes this pattern than “uncivil agreement.” …
