## Abstract
This research explores how emerging social media platforms shape economic voting behavior. Leveraging the 2016 and 2020 ANES datasets, I theorize that social-media usage increases the weight of national economic evaluations (“sociotropic voting”) while simultaneously biasing these evaluations through homophilous networks and filter bubbles.

## 1  Introduction
Social media have transformed political communication. Yet their effect on voters’ economic considerations remains unclear. …

## 2  Information, Media, and Economic Voting
Classic studies link national-economy evaluations to electoral outcomes (MacKuen et al. 1992; Duch & Stevenson 2006). …

## 3  Emerging Social Media
Key features:  
- **Ease of information access** (user-generated flow, diminished gatekeeping)  
- **Homophily & echo chambers** reinforcing partisan bias …

## 4  Theoretical Framework
Two hypotheses:  
- **H1:** Greater exposure to political content on social media increases the weight of national economic evaluation in vote choice.  
- **H2:** For partisans, higher exposure biases national-economy perceptions in favor of their party, influencing votes accordingly. …

## 5  Data and Methods
Three regression models using ANES 2016 & 2020 test the weight and direction of economic voting, controlling for political sophistication, interest, and partisanship. …

## 6  Discussion and Limitations
Survey-based designs face measurement error and endogeneity; nonetheless, results highlight social-media’s dual role in both informing and biasing economic voters. …
